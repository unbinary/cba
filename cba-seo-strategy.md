# CBA Website SEO Content Strategy
## Canadians for Broadcast Accountability (cba-tv.ca)

---

## 1. Executive Summary: Top 5 SEO Priorities

1. **Own "How to File a CRTC Complaint" Content** - The CRTC's own guidance is scattered, bureaucratic, and hard to navigate. Create the definitive plain-language guide that ranks above or alongside crtc.gc.ca.

2. **Build the CRTC Intervention Guide** - Almost no accessible content exists explaining how ordinary Canadians can participate in CRTC hearings. This is a significant content gap with virtually no competition.

3. **Create Consumer Rights Hub for TV/Broadcasting** - The TV Service Provider Code exists but few Canadians know their rights. Become the go-to explainer.

4. **Develop Educational "Broadcasting 101" Content** - Build authority through foundational educational content that earns links from universities, media studies programs, and journalism schools.

5. **Target Frustrated Cable Subscribers** - Capture search traffic from people searching for help with cable complaints, billing issues, and channel disputes.

Q: What's the difference between CRTC and CCTS complaints?
A: CRTC handles broadcasting content and regulatory issues. CCTS handles billing disputes, contract issues, and service quality problems with TV service providers.

Q: Can I complain about loud TV commercials?
