# CBA Website SEO Content Strategy

## For Claude Research Mode

Copy this prompt into Claude to develop an SEO content strategy for the public-facing pages of Canadians for Broadcast Accountability (cba-tv.ca).

**Note:** We have gated content (password-protected campaign pages) that won't be indexed. This strategy focuses only on public pages that can rank in search.

## Research Prompt

I'm developing an SEO content strategy for "Canadians for Broadcast Accountability" (cba-tv.ca), a Canadian consumer advocacy organization focused on holding broadcasters accountable to their CRTC licence obligations.

**Current public pages:**
- / (homepage)
- /about
- /issues (index only - specific campaigns are gated)
- /resources
- /resources/how-to-complain
- /resources/how-to-intervene
- /contact
- /take-action

**Goals:**
1. Rank for informational queries about CRTC processes (complaints, interventions)
2. Establish authority on Canadian broadcasting consumer issues
3. Capture frustrated cable/TV subscribers searching for help
4. Build organic traffic that can be converted to email subscribers

**Constraints:**
- No specific company names in SEO strategy (campaign content is gated)
- Focus on evergreen, educational content
- Canadian audience only (en-CA)
- Small organization - need to compete on long-tail, not head terms

---

## Please Research and Provide:

### 1. Keyword Opportunity Analysis

**For each public page, identify:**
- Primary keyword (realistic to rank for)
- 3-5 secondary keywords
- 5-10 long-tail question keywords (for FAQ schema and "People Also Ask")
- Search volume estimates (if available) and competition assessment
- Content gaps vs existing CRTC.gc.ca content (what can we explain better?)

**Focus areas:**
- CRTC complaint process
- CRTC intervention/hearing participation
- Cable TV consumer rights Canada
- Broadcasting regulation basics
- How to cancel cable / reduce cable bill (if relevant to mandate)

### 2. Competitor Content Analysis

**Research these sites for content gaps and opportunities:**
- crtc.gc.ca (official - what do they explain poorly?)
- ccts-cprst.ca (telecom complaints)
- piac.ca (Public Interest Advocacy Centre)
- openmedia.org (digital rights)

**Identify:**
- Topics they cover that we should cover
- Topics they DON'T cover that we could own
- Their top-ranking content (what works?)
- Backlink opportunities (who links to them?)

### 3. Content Recommendations by Page

**For each public page, provide:**

```
PAGE: [url]

Current state: [brief assessment if you can see it]

Recommended H1: [title]
Meta description: [150-160 chars]
Primary keyword: [keyword]

Content sections needed:
1. [H2 section]
2. [H2 section]
...

FAQ schema content:
Q: [question - use actual search queries]
A: [concise answer]

Word count target: [number]
Internal links to add: [pages]
External links needed: [authoritative sources]
```

### 4. New Page Recommendations

**Should we create additional public pages? Consider:**
- /resources/your-rights (consumer rights overview)
- /resources/broadcasting-101 (educational primer)
- /resources/glossary (CRTC terminology)
- /blog or /news (for freshness signals)

**For each recommendation, provide:**
- Keyword opportunity
- Content outline
- Effort vs. impact assessment

### 5. Technical SEO Recommendations

**Based on best practices for advocacy/nonprofit sites:**
- Schema markup opportunities beyond Organization (FAQPage, HowTo, etc.)
- Internal linking strategy
- URL structure recommendations
- Page speed considerations
- Mobile optimization priorities

### 6. Content Calendar Framework

**Map content to CRTC's regulatory calendar:**
- When do major licence renewals typically happen?
- Policy consultation windows
- Annual report releases
- News hooks we can anticipate

**Suggest:**
- Evergreen vs. timely content ratio
- Update frequency for each page type
- Social sharing optimization

### 7. Link Building Opportunities

**For a small advocacy org, identify:**
- Canadian news outlets that cover CRTC/telecom
- Academic institutions studying Canadian media
- Other advocacy orgs for cross-linking
- Government/official resources we can cite (for credibility)
- HARO/journalist query opportunities
