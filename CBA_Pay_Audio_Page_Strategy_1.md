# CBA Website: Pay Audio Issue Page

## Build Brief for Claude Code

**Page URL:** /issues/pay-audio  
**Domain:** cba-tv.ca  
**Framework:** Next.js + Tailwind (per main site brief)

---

## Page Purpose

Explain the pay audio bundling issue to everyday Canadians and drive petition signatures. This is a consumer choice issue - keep it simple, relatable, and action-oriented.

---

## Core Message

**One sentence:** Millions of Canadians pay for Stingray Music through their cable bill whether they use it or not - and they can't remove it.

**Tone:** Frustrated but factual. Not angry, not wonky. Think: a neighbor explaining their cable bill problem over coffee.

---

## Page Structure

### Hero Section

**Headline:** "Paying for Music Channels You Never Use?"

**Subhead:** If you have cable TV in Canada, you're probably paying for Stingray Music - even if you've never tuned in.

**CTA Button:** "Sign the Petition" → links to petition section or Change.org

---

### Section 1: The Problem

**Header:** What is Pay Audio?

**Content (conversational prose, no bullets):**

Stingray Music is a service that plays commercial-free music channels through your TV. It's bundled into most cable packages in Canada - Rogers, Bell, Telus, Shaw, and others all include it.

The catch? You can't remove it. If you're on anything above the bare-bones $25 basic package, Stingray Music is baked into your bill. You pay for it whether you listen or not.

This isn't a small add-on. Stingray collects tens of millions of dollars annually from Canadian cable subscribers. Most of those "subscribers" never chose the service - they just can't opt out.

---

### Section 2: Why This Matters

**Header:** It's Your Money

**Content:**

In 2016, the CRTC promised Canadians more choice over their cable bills. They introduced pick-and-pay options and a slimmed-down basic package.

But here's what actually happened: cable companies made the cheap package unattractive. Switch to basic and your internet bill goes up. Your equipment fees increase. You lose bundle discounts. For most people, "choice" is an illusion.

Meanwhile, services like Stingray Music stay embedded in packages - guaranteed revenue from millions of households that never asked for it.

---

### Section 3: The Numbers

**Header:** By the Numbers

**Display as simple stat cards or clean layout (not bullets):**

| Stat | Context |
|------|---------|
| 10+ million | Canadian households with Stingray Music in their cable package |
| ~784,000 | People who actually chose to subscribe directly |
| $47M+ | Estimated annual Canadian pay audio revenue |
| 4% | Amount Stingray contributes to Canadian music development |
| $0 | What you save by asking to remove it (you can't) |

---

### Section 4: What We're Asking For

**Header:** The Fix is Simple

**Content:**

We're asking the CRTC to give Canadians a real choice:

**Let us opt out.** If I don't use Stingray Music, I shouldn't have to pay for it. Cable companies should offer it as an add-on, not a forced inclusion.

**Make pricing transparent.** Consumers deserve to know what portion of their cable bill goes to services they never requested.

**Hold broadcasters accountable.** When the CRTC reviews Stingray's license in 2027, they should consider whether bundling unwilling subscribers serves the public interest.

---

### Section 5: Take Action

**Header:** Add Your Voice

**Content:**

The CRTC reviews Stingray Music's broadcast license in 2027. Before that happens, we're building a record of Canadians who want the right to choose.

**Petition Embed/Link:** [Change.org petition or embedded form]

**Email Signup:** 
- Heading: "Stay Updated"
- Subtext: Get notified when the CRTC opens public comments on pay audio.
- Fields: Email (required), Postal Code (optional)

---

### Section 6: FAQ (Optional - Collapsible)

**Q: Can't I just call my cable company and remove it?**
A: No. Stingray Music is bundled at the wholesale level. Your cable company buys it as part of their programming package and passes the cost to you. Individual customers cannot opt out.

**Q: What about the $25 skinny basic package?**
A: That package doesn't include Stingray Music, but cable companies make it economically unattractive. Customers report losing bundle discounts and seeing increases in equipment fees and internet charges when they switch.

**Q: Does Stingray Music support Canadian artists?**
A: Stingray is required to contribute 4% of pay audio revenues to Canadian music development funds. However, this doesn't justify forcing millions of Canadians to subsidize a service they don't use.

**Q: When can I tell the CRTC about this?**
A: Stingray Music's license expires August 31, 2027. The CRTC will issue a Notice of Consultation approximately one year before, opening a 30-day window for public comments. Sign up for our email list and we'll notify you when that window opens.

- Stat cards should be visually distinct but not flashy
- Mobile-first - most petition traffic comes from social shares on phones

## Petition Text (for Change.org or similar)

**Title:** Give Canadians the Right to Remove Pay Audio from Cable Bills

**Target:** Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)

**Body:**

Millions of Canadian cable subscribers pay for Stingray Music every month - whether they use it or not. 

This "pay audio" service is bundled into cable packages from Rogers, Bell, Telus, and other providers. Customers cannot remove it without downgrading to the bare-minimum basic package, which cable companies make economically unattractive through lost discounts and increased fees.

In 2016, the CRTC promised Canadians more control over their cable bills. That promise hasn't been kept. Services like Stingray Music remain embedded in packages, generating tens of millions in annual revenue from households that never chose to subscribe.

We call on the CRTC to:

1. **Require true opt-out** - Canadians should be able to remove pay audio services from their cable package without penalty

2. **Mandate transparent pricing** - Consumers should know what they're paying for bundled services

3. **Consider consumer value at license renewal** - When Stingray Music's license comes up for renewal in 2027, the CRTC should evaluate whether forced bundling serves the public interest

Cable TV is expensive enough. Canadians shouldn't be forced to pay for services they don't use.

**[Sign the Petition]**
